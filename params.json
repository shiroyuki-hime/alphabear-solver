{"name":"Alphabear-solver","tagline":"A script to solve Alphabear game boards","body":"# Alphabear Solver\r\n\r\nA simple python script that is intended to be used to solve game boards on the mobile game \r\n[Alphabear](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spryfox.alphabear&hl=en) by Spry Fox.\r\n\r\nCan also be used as a [Countdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_(game_show)#Letters_round) with an arbitrary number of letters, not just 8 like in the game show.\r\n\r\nUses a dictionary, generated to `map.json`, from `dictionary.txt`. It's the \"official\" [SOWPODS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOWPODS) dictionary.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo use this script, you'll need Python 3 installed.\r\n\r\n1. Make sure you have a tone of words in `dictionary.txt`, one word per line. A wordlist is included here but you can modify it if you want.\r\n2. Run `hashdict.py`\r\n3. Run `solver.py`\r\n\r\nEverytime you change/update the dictionary, you'll need to rerun `hashdict.py`\r\n\r\n## Todo\r\n\r\n* Read letters from game input.\r\n* Weight letters so that ones with less moves remaining, worth more points etc. are preferred by the matching algorithm.\r\n* Grab better dictionary, preferably the one used in the actual game.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\n* Dictionary (`dictionary.txt`) is taken from here: https://code.google.com/p/scrabblehelper/source/browse/trunk/ScrabbleHelper/src/dictionaries/sowpods.txt?r=20\r\n* [The World's Fastest Scrabble Program](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15451-s06/www/lectures/scrabble.pdf) - \r\nAndrew W. Appel & Guy J. Jacobson (1988)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
